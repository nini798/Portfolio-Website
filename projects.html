                Poppy's Island is a visual novel that I'm working on. It features four unique routes, a continuous storyline between paths, and choices with lasting consequences.
                <br> This project incorporates coding, writing, composing, marketing, communication between artists, and design.

                Unnamed RPG
            </h2>
            <p>
                This game in progress hasn't found a suitable name, nor a code name. Despite that, significant work has been made on the game.<br>
                A product of Snaptoast Games, this game is a role-playing game with a heavy emphasis on class systems and switching between class mechanics.<br>
                Extensive testing has taken place by creating a mock-up of the battle system within RPGMaker, and much of the lore and backstory has been fleshed out as well.<br>
                Look forward to updates on this game!
