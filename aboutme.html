                This is me.
                <br><br>
                I'm a Computational Media major at Georgia Tech. I'm also minoring in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.
                <br><br>
                I'm a co-partner of SnapToast Games, working on a visual novel called Poppy's Island. I'm also working on an unnamed RPG. 
                <br>
                I've worked with a multitude of coding languages, mainly Java, Python, and Ren'py. I've also worked with Matlab, C#, and html/css (duh).
                <br>
                I'm also into creative writing and composing music, mainly for the visual novel.
                <br><br>
                I am a huge fan of games and game design, my all-time favorite series being Super Smash Bros, and a recent favorite being Persona 5.
                <br><br>
                My other hobbies include watching Netflix, playing Dungeons and Dragons, and sleeping in.
